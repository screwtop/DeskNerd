These files can be copied into your user or system-wide configuration directory for Ion3 ("~/.ion3/" for yourself).

You may also need to make changes to your main Ion config (TODO: details).

TODO: a proper installation script?  Note that I've now rearranged some of my Ion config files, but haven't pulled those into here yet.
