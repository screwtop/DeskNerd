Options and considerations for how to display calendar entries for the current day:
	A menu with timeslots could be an effective way to do this.
	Timeslots with only one items can just display the item within the menu label.
	Can menu items span multiple lines?
	Timeslots with multiple items could have a submenu for browsing to these.
	Can menu items contain buttons?
	The timeslot pattern should be a user preference.  Some options:
		Only show timeslots that actually contain events (i.e. no pattern).
		Only show timeslots for certain ranges (e.g. working hours on weekdays).
		Custom timeslots (e.g. 45-minute timeslots, things starting on the half hour, irregular patterns).
	Instantaneous events (e.g. deadlines) should show up within the appropriate timeslot (if using a timeslot pattern), otherwise just at the specific time recorded for the event.
	For single-item timeslots, when showing appointment inline, display minimal useful :1 data, e.g. time, brief description (possibly abbrev'd, somehow), place.
	Colour coding for items?  A user preference for styles would be good, e.g.
		Important -> red background, white foreground, bold text, maybe even text size and font.
		Deadline -> ...
		Entertainment -> blue bg, white fg
		(Tk would make all this stuff pretty easy, I have to admit!)
		(Colour coding would also help distinguish busy timeslots from non-busy)


menu .calendar_day_menu
	.calendar_day_menu add command -label { 9:00} -command {}
	.calendar_day_menu add command -label {10:00} -command {}
	.calendar_day_menu add command -label {11:00} -command {}
	.calendar_day_menu add command -label {12:00} -command {}
bind . <3> "tk_popup .calendar_day_menu %X %Y"

# Ah, you can determine menu entry indexes using [menu index]:
	.calendar_day_menu index { 9:00}
