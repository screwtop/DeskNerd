[ ] You can add a title to menus, which is useful for when they are torn off (which is actually a nice feature for the detailed status info menus).  menu -title <title>

[ ] Figure out how to make certain labels in menus bold (e.g. for the application title entries).

[ ] Add iowait meter to CPU meter.  Maybe coming down from the top of the scale?

[ ] Implement a temperature meter (perhaps textual rather than graphical).  "sensors" or /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature?

[ ] Implement a battery/power meter.  Could show battery charge, AC/battery power source state, etc.
