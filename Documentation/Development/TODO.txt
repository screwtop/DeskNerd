[ ] You can add a title to menus, which is useful for when they are torn off (which is actually a nice feature for the detailed status info menus).  menu -title <title>

[ ] Figure out how to make certain labels in menus bold (e.g. for the application title entries).

[ ] Set -direction above|below|left|right for systray menubuttons according to whether the systray is at the bottom/top/right/left of the screen.  Perhaps even determine where on the screen we are and do it automatically, rather than relying on some kind of setting.
