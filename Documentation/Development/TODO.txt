[ ] You can add a title to menus, which is useful for when they are torn off (which is actually a nice feature for the detailed status info menus).  menu -title <title>

[ ] Figure out how to make certain labels in menus bold (e.g. for the application title entries).

[ ] Set -direction above|below|left|right for systray menubuttons according to whether the systray is at the bottom/top/right/left of the screen.  Perhaps even determine where on the screen we are and do it automatically, rather than relying on some kind of setting.

[ ] Have the menu dismissed by a click on the menubutton, if possible.  Can we bind to click and check the menu state?

# Something a bit like:
bind .clipboard <1> {.clipboard.menu unpost}	;# Not quite: makes the menu single-use!
.clipboard.menu index active	;# Returns none if nothing selected. Probably not reliable.

# Not quite either: still makes the menu single-use!
bind .clipboard <1> {
	if {[.clipboard.menu index active] != "none"} {
		.clipboard.menu unpost
	}
}
