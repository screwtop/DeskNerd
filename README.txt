DeskNerd:
A collection of scripts and components designed for used with the Ion window manager on Linux.

Ion's tabbed, pane-oriented way of managing windows and workspaces is wonderful, but the default 
statusbar is a little spartan.  DeskNerd provides some handy programs to pop in the systray(s) in 
the statusbar, a mechanism for boosting the CPU and IO priority of the window that has focus, and 
whatever other things I can think of and implement.
