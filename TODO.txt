[ ] Maybe create a subdirectory for systray plugins and move the Tk stuff there.
[ ] Make a directory for Ion-specific configuration files and import those.
[ ] Figure out how best to structure the project(s) to work with git.
[ ] Factor out gauge rendering code (while still allowing custom functions and perhaps also custom colour mapping).
[ ] Parameterise the I/O meter for device name.
[ ] Make CPU meter figure out number of CPUs automatically.
[ ] Consider using /proc/meminfo for memory.tcl for greater detail and accuracy in accounting for memory.  For example, "Mapped" can be several hundred MB and probably shouldn't count as "unused".
[ ] Be smarter with clipboard selection type handling: Chromium doesn't seem to like UTF8_STRING!
