#!/usr/bin/expectk

# A basic JACK Audio Connection Kit control systray utility for DeskNerd.
# Will provide a popup menu (or menus) for managing port connections, viewing JACK process status info, etc.  See Documentation/Development/JACK.txt for design details.
# Actually, it might be easier to make calls to jacklib directly.  Not something I've set up for Tcl before, but AFAICT it should be fairly straightforward.  See the separate TclJACK project.

# TODO: having Tcl's pattern matching and list handling will enable some nice features, I think:
# [ ] Connecting all ports for a client to another client (mapping 1:1).
# [ ] Disconnecting all MPlayer instances (mplayer includes the PID in its JACK client name, but we can do a pattern match).
# [ ] Disconnecting all output ports for a client.
# ...
# [ ] Perhaps most significantly, we can choose a playback port that we want to monitor (e.g. system:playback_1 and 2 for the main soundcard outputs), query to find all JACK output ports that connect to it, and connect those to this program, so it will display the effective output signal of the entire system!  I'd wondered how I was going to do that.


# We're going to be using expect features, to run expectk, not wish.
# Note also that expect ofter lags a bit; we have Tcl 8.4 for expect ATM, but 8.5 otherwise.

# TODO: implement a timer loop to keep the stats up-to-date (once a second?), and another (once every 1/n s) for updating the level meter gauge.  Could adapt the following:
#proc every {ms body} {eval $body; after $ms [info level 0]}
#set nmax 3
#every 1000 {puts hello; if {[incr ::nmax -1]<=0} return}

# Maybe we don't even need both ways of looking at it: ergonomically, you'd usually have a source, which you find, and then go looking for where you want to send it.  But there may be situations where you'd start with the sink port and then go looking for a source (for setting up a track for recording in Ardour, for example).

# Various procedures to gather JACK state data through the jack_* commands.

# Get a list of JACK ports.  All ports, or have separate procs for playback and capture ports?  Might be nice to only call jack_lsp once and gather as much information as possible, for efficiency (assuming starting new process is more expensive than piping and processing a little more text).

		# I assume colons are not allowed in JACK client or port names (only as the separator between these).
		# Spaces are allowed (mplayer uses them by default).  Are leading or trailing spaces permitted?  I'll assume not.
		# Are tabs permitted in client/port names?
		# Are leading digits permitted in client/port names?

# Literal port names containing "[]$" etc will obviously need to be escaped or written in curly braces for Tcl.
# TODO: error handling?
# <<ERROR b not a valid port>>
# <<child process exited abnormally>>
# Also, watch for naming conflicts here if in a Tcl environment that will try to call system command as well ("jack_connect" == "jack_connect"!).

	set content [split [read $input] \n]

# Could imagine doing jack_disconnect with pattern matching to avoid having to look up and list the sink port name(s) for example.
